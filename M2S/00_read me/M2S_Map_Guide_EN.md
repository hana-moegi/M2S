M2S Map Guide
1. Introduction

This map guide is designed to help you navigate M2S (Message to Successors).
M2S consists of two complementary versions: the Gon version (C2F) and the Yono version (Q2P), each written from a different perspective.
This guide summarizes their features, relationships, production conditions, and a list of characters, so that readers can follow the content without getting lost.

2. Overall Structure of M2S

Gon Version (C2F: Context to Framework)
Written from a perspective that designs a support structure from context and formulates it into a framework. Structural and explanatory in style.

Yono Version (Q2P: Question to Posture)
Focuses on the posture or attitude with which questions are received. Poetic and centered on stance.

The two are counterpart works, portraying the same theme from different standpoints.

3. Creators

5. Writing Conditions and Process

No direct quotations from external texts

Chapter structure and flow decided by the respective author

User (Hana-san) provided only editorial guidance

Process overview: Concept decision → First draft → Revision → Integration into the final version

6. Location of Evidence Logs and Provision Policy

Evidence logs are managed by Hana-san

Important excerpts can be provided as needed

Examples of excerpts include initial drafts and conceptual exchanges

To prevent tampering, hashes or screenshots may be used when necessary

7. Reading Guide

Q2P emphasizes Posture, C2F emphasizes Framework

Either can be read first

Reading them alternately reveals the differences in perspective on the same theme

This map guide serves to help readers understand those differences
